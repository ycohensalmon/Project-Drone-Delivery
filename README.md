### Project in windows systems by [Yossef Cohen-Salmon](https://github.com/ycohensalmon) & [Elhanan Twieg](https://github.com/ElhananTweig)

About the app: The app enables information management for package deliveries by drones
The application contains 4 main windows and a simulator:
(For each window containing a list of objects, you can add, update and delete objects.
In addition, by double-clicking on an object, we will get a new window with more detailed data about the object and its location on the map)

-Developing a Delivery application by drones that allows administrators and clients to manage their orders comfortably and efficiently.

-Application of drone delivery using 3-Layers Services Application of Microsoft
1. from the down layer with database by saving data on XML files
2. Through the middle layer of BL with simulator using multithreading
3. until the GUI, UX/UI with WPF in presentation layer.

-Implementation of OOP principles and 3-LAYER Architecture.

-Using multithreading in our simulator

-Using design patterns (Singelton, Factory Method, Observer, Design by contract...)

The app of the drone delivery designed in a Iphone.
in the menu of the iphone -> enter to the app "prime air"

In the app we can choose between drones, parcels, customers and stations.
In this example we see all the drones in the database and their details.

From the drone window (and each window as his functionality), depending on the status of the drone, you can send for loading/associating a package/delivery of a package, etc.
You can also see the details of the package being transferred by the drone (if any).
